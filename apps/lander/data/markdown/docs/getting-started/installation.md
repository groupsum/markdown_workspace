`mdwrk` is the client and package surface. The lander is only the documentation and release site.

Choose the workflow that matches how you consume the client.

## Use the Web App
Open the mdwrk lander and launch the app from the primary action. The workspace runs in the browser and keeps documents local by default.

## Install as a PWA
Modern browsers can install mdwrk as a Progressive Web App.

1. Open mdwrk in Chrome, Edge, Safari, or another PWA-capable browser.
2. Use the browser install action from the address bar or share menu.
3. Launch mdwrk from the installed app icon when you want a focused workspace window.

Installed PWAs still use browser storage, so keep your normal backup and export habits in place.

## Use the Packages
Install the published workspace client package:

```bash
npm install @mdwrk/mdwrkspace
```

Use the split packages directly when you only need one surface:

```bash
npm install @mdwrk/markdown-editor-react @mdwrk/markdown-renderer-react
```

For package discovery, use the organization page:

```text
https://www.npmjs.com/org/mdwrk
```

## ESM CDN
Load the published client from an ESM CDN and mount it directly:

```html
<div id="mdwrkspace-root"></div>
<script type="module">
  import { mountMdWork } from "https://esm.sh/@mdwrk/mdwrkspace";

  const root = document.getElementById("mdwrkspace-root");
  mountMdWork(root);
</script>
```

## Extensions
Bundled extensions ship with the client build. External installable extensions follow the signed-manifest and trust-policy path documented in the extension docs.

## Production Hosting
When hosting the lander yourself, build the static app and serve the generated output through a web server or container. Set `VITE_SITE_URL` during the build so `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` point to the correct production origin.

```bash
VITE_SITE_URL=https://mdwrk.com npm run build -w apps/lander
```

The production container is designed to sit behind a reverse proxy such as Nginx Proxy Manager.

## Updates
As a PWA, the client updates automatically in the background. You will see a notification when a new version is ready.
